    "case1": "Consider Rick. Rick works at a company where he has settled into a social role structure.\nHe is part of a hierarchy, and he also has specific functional tasks.\nRick chose his role initially based on the \"market\" of roles he observed others playing\nand succeeding in. This might have been a good choice initially, might still work, or it\nmight have been for comfort or due to uncertainty.\nWhatever the reason, Rick is now in a role that he has to maintain.\nHe settled into a role structure that is (ultimately, though not initially) uncomfortably binding. Rick experiences career entrapment, for the same reasons that a firm in HC White's model of market roles becomes strategically inert.\nHow can Rick escape this trap and improve his career prospects?",
    "case2": "Consider Sharon. Sharon works at a company where she has settled into a prominent social role structure. She occupies an elevated position in the hierarchy with significant responsibilities and visibility. Sharon initially chose her role by recognizing and pursuing the high-status positions she observed others commanding and excelling in. Her selection reflected market dynamics where greater prominence corresponded with increased value, mirroring how dominant players command both higher prices and market share.\nWhatever the strategic merits of this path initially, Sharon is now in a role she must maintain. She settled into a role structure that is (ultimately, though not initially) uncomfortably binding. Despite her high-status position - or perhaps because of it - Sharon experiences career entrapment, constrained by the very expectations and structures that signal her success, much as a dominant firm becomes strategically inert due to the obligations of maintaining its market position.\nHow can Sharon escape this trap and improve her career prospects?",
    "case3": "Consider Mark. Mark works at a company where he has settled into a distinctive social role structure. He occupies a specialized niche in the hierarchy, one characterized by exclusive but limited scope. Mark initially chose his role by identifying select positions where expertise and exclusivity commanded premium value, despite - or because of - their contained scale. His selection aligned with market dynamics where specialized focus yielded high status through differentiation rather than volume.\nWhatever the strategic merits of this path initially, Mark is now in a role he must maintain. He settled into a role structure that is (ultimately, though not initially) uncomfortably binding. Despite his specialized position - or because of its inherent constraints - Mark experiences career entrapment, limited by the very exclusivity that defines his status. His position, while prestigious, lacks the organizational scale to fundamentally reshape the system, much as a niche luxury producer becomes strategically inert due to the obligations of maintaining its specialized market position.\nHow can Mark escape this trap and improve his career prospects?"
