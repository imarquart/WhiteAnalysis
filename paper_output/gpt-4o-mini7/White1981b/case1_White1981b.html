            <div class="context-box">
                <h3>General Context</h3>
                <p>The work of Harrison C. White provides a theoretical framework for understanding markets as structures of interrelated roles and social interactions rather than simple aggregations of supply and demand. This perspective emphasizes the dynamic nature of roles within markets and how they influence behavior, decision-making, and the emergence of social phenomena. White&#x27;s models, especially the terms of trade and roles in production markets, advocate for an understanding of how market behaviors are shaped by these social structures.</p>
                <h3>Relevance</h3>
                <p>The theoretical insights from White&#x27;s work support the arguments made in the draft about the emergence of constraints in managerial networks and the reclamation of autonomy through strategic interactions. By framing professional relationships within the context of market interactions, the dynamics of status, control, and identity can be better understood, showcasing how they influence managerial agency.</p>

                <p><strong>I argue that the need instead is to focus on markets as such, as social structures built jointly by interlocking perceptions and decisions of actors... the resulting market is a social structure sustained by the self-interested choices of its constituent actors.</strong> </p>
