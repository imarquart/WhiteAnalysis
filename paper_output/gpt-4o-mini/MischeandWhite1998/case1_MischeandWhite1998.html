            <div class="context-box">
                <h3>General Context</h3>
                <p>The paper explores the concept of publics and their role in facilitating transitions between different specialized social domains (netdoms), specifically highlighting public switching dynamics and their implications for agency and identity formation.</p>
                <h3>Relevance</h3>
                <p>This aligns with the argument in our paper about how strategic interactions, like conversational frame-switching, can help individuals navigate professional constraints by reshaping their network ties and roles.</p>

            <h3>Extracted Quotes</h3>
        
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>&quot;Publics can be defined as interstitial social spaces characterized by short-term copresences, as well as by intersections between multiple network domains... they function by reducing the uncertain and problematic nature of such spaces by positing minimally recognizable identities.&quot;</strong> </p>
                <div class="quote-context">Discussing how short-term public exchanges can serve to bridge between more structured network domains, highlighting the role of conversations in easing transitions.</div>
                <div class="quote-position"><strong>Position:</strong> Page 696</div>
                <div class="quote-issue_in_draft"><strong>Issue in Draft:</strong> Our narratives highlight pathways along which professional relationships—initially pursued for career advantage—crystallize into binding constraints.</div>
                <div class="quote-relation">
                    <strong>Relevance:</strong> This supports our assertion that managing conversations within strategic interactions—characterized as &#x27;publics&#x27;—can help navigate constraints within professional networks.

            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>&quot;Situations demand active response. They may thus provide opportunities for entrepreneurs to seize action in more projective and practically evaluative ways, enabling them to recombine story lines and reconfigure relations with a relatively greater degree of reflection and intentionality.&quot;</strong> </p>
                <div class="quote-context">The discussion reflects on the transformative potential of interruptions in routine interactions, sparking new dynamics among social ties and network domains, shedding light on how social situations can emerge.</div>
                <div class="quote-position"><strong>Position:</strong> Page 709</div>
                <div class="quote-issue_in_draft"><strong>Issue in Draft:</strong> We also describe how strategies such as annealing, network reach, and prolepsis restore autonomy.</div>
                <div class="quote-relation">
                    <strong>Relevance:</strong> This reinforces our argument that interruptions and training in conversational dynamics can enable actors to actively reconfigure their network ties, thus regaining autonomy.

            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>&quot;Conversations ostensibly have no future (and no effects on surrounding netdoms), although they may surreptitiously allow actors to accumulate cross-domain information and impressions, thus providing material for situational mobilizations.&quot;</strong> </p>
                <div class="quote-context">Illustrating how conversations can shift into situations as network dynamics evolve, particularly when discussions become fraught with emotional stakes.</div>
                <div class="quote-position"><strong>Position:</strong> Page 712</div>
                <div class="quote-issue_in_draft"><strong>Issue in Draft:</strong> We thus portray autonomy as a fluid condition, regained through strategic interactions that reconfigure network ties and conversational frames.</div>
                <div class="quote-relation">
                    <strong>Relevance:</strong> This highlights the fluidity of autonomy in professional roles and how strategic conversations can transform into pivotal moments (situations), facilitating autonomy reclamation.
