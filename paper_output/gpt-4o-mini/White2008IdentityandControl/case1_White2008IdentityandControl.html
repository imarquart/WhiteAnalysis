                <h3>General Context</h3>
                <p>The emergence of constraints within managerial networks can be rooted in the binding nature of professional relationships, often initially pursued for career advancement. Drawing on Harrison C. White&#x27;s theoretical frameworks, these constraints can manifest through social structures that limit individual autonomy and agency.</p>
                <h3>Relevance</h3>
                <p>Whites concepts support the idea that entrapment in managerial roles often arises from the expectations tied to network interactions, and that strategic reconfigurations of these interactions may cultivate autonomy.</p>
