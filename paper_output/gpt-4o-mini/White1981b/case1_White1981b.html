            <h2>Insight Set 1</h2>
            
            <div class="context-box">
                <h3>General Context</h3>
                <p>Harrison C. White’s work discusses markets as social structures where individuals enter roles based on their interactions and perceptions within the market context. His theory emphasizes that individuals&#x27; decisions and identities are shaped by their social relationships and the structure of the market.</p>
                <h3>Relevance</h3>
                <p>This context highlights how managerial networks can induce roles and constrain individual agency, akin to the experiences of Sofia and Carl in the draft. White&#x27;s concept of terms of trade and role structures can further illuminate the dynamics presented in the paper.</p>

            <h3>Extracted Quotes</h3>
        
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>&quot;The problem is which sets of producer firms and of buyers for their outputs can together sustain a market. Once established, a market is experienced by each actor as an overpowering regimen; the terms of trade are social facts that brook no contradiction.&quot;</strong> </p>
                <div class="quote-context">Understanding the role structure formed by interactions within a market.</div>
                <div class="quote-position"><strong>Position:</strong> Page 2, Paragraph 3</div>
                <div class="quote-issue_in_draft"><strong>Issue in Draft:</strong> Why might a manager find that relationships with colleagues-pursued for seemingly rational reasons-eventually crystallize as binding constraints?</div>
                <div class="quote-relation">
                    <strong>Relevance:</strong> This supports the argument that once professional relationships take root within a managerial network, they can solidify into binding constraints that limit autonomy and agency, much like the terms of trade in a market.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>&quot;The term role usually evokes either examples ingrained in our culture... but everyday social structure consists in a host of mutual regularities in enacted and perceived behavior that go beyond such ordained roles.&quot;</strong> </p>
                <div class="quote-context">The role structure leads to expectations that constrain individual choices.</div>
                <div class="quote-position"><strong>Position:</strong> Page 3, Middle</div>
                <div class="quote-issue_in_draft"><strong>Issue in Draft:</strong> How strategies such as annealing, network reach, and prolepsis restore autonomy.</div>
                <div class="quote-relation">
                    <strong>Relevance:</strong> This quote reinforces the idea that managers—like Sofia and Carl—operate within a web of expectations that affect their autonomy, and changing such expectations (through strategies like annealing) can help restore agency.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p><strong>&quot;Since I appear to intrude on the terrain of economic theory (as I think sociologists should), I clarify the nature of this intrusion in the next section.&quot;</strong> </p>
                <div class="quote-context">Roles formed in the market create expectations that can constrain or facilitate agency.</div>
                <div class="quote-position"><strong>Position:</strong> Page 4, Paragraph 2</div>
                <div class="quote-issue_in_draft"><strong>Issue in Draft:</strong> The interaction of identity, control, and status in managerial contexts.</div>
                <div class="quote-relation">
                    <strong>Relevance:</strong> This illustrates the theoretical approach positioned between sociology and economics, shedding light on how status and identity are constructed within managerial roles, indeed forming the constraints mentioned in the draft.
